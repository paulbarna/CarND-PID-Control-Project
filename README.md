# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

The P term is the proportional term 
The cross track error, cte is the distance between the current COG of the vehicle and the track limit. To get the P coefficient we multiply Kp (a proportional factor) parameter with the cte. As a result the vehicle will steer back to the track in order to minimize the cte, giving the direction of the PID correction. When Kp is too high PIDs are overshooting, while if Kp is too low the car veers off track within the corners.

The D term is the differential term. 
To get the D coefficient we multiply Kd parameter with the difference between the current cte and the previous cte (instantaneous rate of change for cte) . As a result we suppress the overshooting caused by latency, or the oscillation. If Kd is too high we have significant oscillation, if too low there is overshooting.

The I term is the integral term.
To get the I coefficient we multiply Ki parameter with the overall sum of previous cte (accumulated cte). As a result we eliminate the residual errors of the proportional correction and allow faster laps around the track.If the Ki is too high there is an accumulated error which gives too much weight to the other two coefficients.

## Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen

Initial parameters were chosen by trial and error for both the steering and the throttle PIDs.
After a set number of iterations (for the installation laps the count was set to 10) the Twiddle parameter optimization is called to adjust the coefficients. The state within the twiddle algorithm is recurrently selecting which coefficients are adapted. Best set of parameters is printed to monitor the evolution.
The target throttle error was calculated as an absolute correction with regard to the steering value and then passed into the PID controller.

  pid_steer.Init(0.1, 0.00001, 2);
  pid_throttle.Init(0.1, 0.0008, 0.65);

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
